# Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Citizen vs. Government Traffic Monitoring

**SwanFlow - Advocacy Document**

---

## Executive Summary

This document compares the cost-effectiveness of SwanFlow's citizen-led, open-source approach against government-operated traffic monitoring infrastructure in Western Australia.

### Key Finding

| Metric | SwanFlow | Main Roads WA Smart Freeway |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Cost per monitoring site** | ~$143 AUD | ~$50,000+ AUD |
| **Total system cost** | ~$4,500 (30 sites) | $209.6M+ (Mitchell alone) |
| **Data accessibility** | 100% open | Limited/broken |
| **Real-time API status** | Functional | **Offline since Aug 2023** |

> **The irony**: Main Roads WA spent hundreds of millions on traffic infrastructure, yet their public real-time data API has been broken for over a year. Meanwhile, a $143 DIY device can provide functional, open traffic data.

## Data Accessibility Comparison

### Main Roads WA Public Data

| Data Type | Availability | Format | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------|--------|
| **Real-Time Signalised Intersections** | API | JSON/XML | **OFFLINE since Aug 2023** |
| Traffic Count Sites | Open | GeoJSON | Annual averages only |
| Daily Traffic Data | API | REST | Historical (since 2013) |
| Road Incidents | Open | API | Functional |
| Speed Zones | Open | GeoJSON | Static data |
| Crash Data | Open | CSV | Quarterly updates |

**Critical Gap**: The [Real-Time Traffic Data at Signalised Intersections](https://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/mrwa-real-time-traffic-data-at-signalised-intersections) API has been offline since August 2023 with "no estimated time of resolution."

> Main Roads WA has 1,400+ real-time sensors collecting data 24/7, but this data is **not accessible to the public** via any functional API.

### SwanFlow Data

| Data Type | Availability | Format | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------|--------|
| Real-time vehicle counts | Open | JSON API | Functional |
| Hourly aggregations | Open | JSON API | Functional |
| Historical data | Open | JSON/CSV | Functional |
| Speed estimates | Open | JSON API | Functional |
| Site locations | Open | GeoJSON | Functional |

**Key Difference**: 100% of SwanFlow data is open and accessible via functional APIs.

## Alternative Traffic Data Sources

### Commercial Providers

| Provider | Coverage | Cost | Data Type |
|----------|----------|------|-----------|
| **TomTom Traffic API** | Global | Free tier: 2,500 req/day; Paid: $0.50/1000 | Flow, incidents |
| **Google Maps Platform** | Global | 28,500 loads/month free; then pay-as-go | Traffic layer |
| **HERE Traffic** | Global | Pay-as-you-grow | Flow, incidents |
| **Mapbox Traffic** | Global | Tiered pricing | Flow tiles |

**Limitation**: These provide **derived** traffic data (from probe vehicles/phones), not **primary** sensor data. They're useful for routing but don't provide the granular flow counts needed for traffic engineering.

### Government Open Data Programs

| Program | Location | Model | Data Access |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Waze for Cities** | Global (1,500+ partners) | Free for government | Alerts, jams, incidents |
| **NSW Live Traffic** | New South Wales | Open API | Incidents, cameras |
| **Transport for NSW** | New South Wales | Open Data Hub | Extensive APIs |
| **VicRoads** | Victoria | Open Data | Traffic signals, counts |

**WA Gap**: Western Australia lags behind NSW and Victoria in providing open, functional traffic data APIs.

### Open Source / Community Initiatives

| Initiative | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Open Traffic** | Global platform linking GPS data to OSM | Piloted in Philippines |
| **OpenStreetMap** | Community-mapped road network | Active, no traffic data |
| **Open Transport Map** | EU traffic visualisation | Active in Europe |

## Return on Investment Analysis

### Government Approach

**Investment**: $500M+ (Smart Freeway program)
**Public Data Access**: Minimal/broken
**ROI for Public**: Low

```
Public ROI = Public Benefit / Public Investment
           = (Broken APIs + Limited Data) / $500M
           = Poor
```

### Citizen Approach (SwanFlow)

**Investment**: $4,500 (full freeway corridor)
**Public Data Access**: 100% open
**ROI for Community**: High

```
Community ROI = Community Benefit / Community Investment
              = (Open APIs + Full Data + Innovation Platform) / $4,500
              = Excellent
```

### Comparative ROI

If Main Roads WA made their sensor data open:

```
Enhanced Public ROI = (Open Real-Time Data + Citizen Innovation) / $500M
                    = Transformative
```

The marginal cost of opening existing data is near-zero. The benefit is substantial.

## Conclusion

SwanFlow demonstrates that citizen-led, open-source traffic monitoring can provide valuable insights at a fraction of the cost of government infrastructure. While Main Roads WA has invested over $500 million in Smart Freeway technology, their public data APIs remain broken or non-existent.

**The question is not whether citizen monitoring can replace government infrastructure** - it cannot, and should not. The question is: **why isn't the data from that $500 million investment accessible to the public who funded it?**

Every day, 160,000+ vehicles cross the Narrows Bridge. Every day, 1,400+ sensors collect data about their movement. And every day, that data remains locked away while the official "open data" API has been offline for over a year.

SwanFlow is both a functional alternative and a call to action. We've shown it can be done for $143 per site. Now it's time for Main Roads WA to show what can be done with $500 million.
