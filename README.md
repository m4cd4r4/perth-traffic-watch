## How It Works

### 1. Vehicle Detection (ESP32-CAM)

```
Camera → FOMO Inference → Counting Algorithm → Stats
```

- ESP32-CAM captures frame (QVGA 320x240)
- Edge Impulse FOMO detects vehicles (on-device)
- Counting algorithm tracks vehicles crossing virtual line
- Accumulates stats: total count, hourly count, confidence

### 2. Data Upload (SIM7000A)

```
ESP32 → SIM7000A → 4G LTE → Backend API
```

- Every 60 seconds, upload JSON stats to backend
- Optional: Upload detection images for validation
- Uses ~200-500MB/month data

### 3. Backend Storage (Express + SQLite)

```
API → SQLite → Aggregation → Dashboard
```

- Stores detection events in SQLite
- Aggregates statistics (hourly, daily)
- Serves data to web dashboard via REST API

### 4. Visualisation (Web Dashboard)

```
Dashboard → Fetch API → Chart.js → User
```

- Real-time traffic statistics
- Hourly traffic flow chart
- Recent detections table
- Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

---

## Accuracy

**Target**: >70% detection accuracy in real-world conditions

**Factors affecting accuracy**:
- Good lighting (daytime, well-lit roads)
- Poor lighting (night, heavy shadows)
- Clear camera view
- Occlusions (trees, rain, fog)
- Medium traffic density
- Very high density (overlapping vehicles)

**Validation**: Manual count vs. automated count over 1 hour

## FAQ

### Q: Is this legal?

**A**: Recording vehicles on public roads is generally legal in Australia (WA Surveillance Devices Act 2016). However:
- Don't record audio (requires consent)
- Don't record private property
- May need permit from City of Perth for installation

See [docs/legal-considerations.md](docs/legal-considerations.md) for details.

### Q: How accurate is it?

**A**: Target is >70% accuracy. Actual accuracy depends on:
- Camera angle and positioning
- Lighting conditions
- Traffic density
- Model training quality

Validate with manual counts.

### Q: What about privacy?

**A**: Perth Traffic Watch:
- Uses low-resolution images (QVGA 320x240)
- No facial recognition
- No number plate recognition
- No audio recording
- Anonymous vehicle counts only

### Q: Can I use this commercially?

**A**: Yes! MIT License allows commercial use. However:
- Consult legal advice for privacy compliance
- May need public liability insurance
- Check local regulations

### Q: What's the data usage?

**A**: Estimated ~200-500MB/month per device:
- Stats only: ~9MB/month
- Stats + occasional images: ~150MB/month

### Q: Does it work at night?

**A**: Depends on street lighting:
- Well-lit roads: Yes (requires good ambient light)
- Poorly lit roads: May need IR illumination
- Test at night before deployment

### Q: Can I use WiFi instead of 4G?

**A**: Yes! ESP32-CAM has built-in WiFi:
- Cheaper (no SIM card)
- Requires WiFi access point nearby
- Update firmware to use WiFi instead of LTE

### Q: What about solar power?

**A**: Absolutely!
- 20W solar panel + 12V battery
- Runs 24/7 off-grid
- Add ~$80 to hardware cost
