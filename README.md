## The $143 vs $50,000 Question

Main Roads Western Australia has invested over **$500 million** in Smart Freeway infrastructure with **1,400+ sensors** collecting real-time traffic data. Yet their public APIs have been **offline since August 2023** with no restoration timeline.

SwanFlow demonstrates that **citizen-led monitoring can provide functional, open traffic data for ~$143 per site** — a 350:1 cost advantage.

> **This project is both a technical proof-of-concept and an advocacy tool for open traffic data.**

📊 See [docs/cost-effectiveness-analysis.md](docs/cost-effectiveness-analysis.md) for the full comparison.
🔍 See [docs/mainroads-api-investigation.md](docs/mainroads-api-investigation.md) for our research into the API outage.

## Monitored Stretches

### CBD to Fremantle Corridor (6 km total)

#### 1. **Mounts Bay Road** (PoC ✅)
**Crawley → Point Lewis** (~1.5 km)

- **Status**: Proof of Concept Complete
- **Monitoring Sites**: Kings Park, Mill Point, Fraser Ave, Malcolm St (4 × 2 directions = 8 sites)
- **Characteristics**: Waterfront arterial, minimal side access, ideal closed segment
- **Why It Works**: No side streets → vehicles entering at Crawley are counted at Point Lewis

#### 2. **Stirling Highway - Swanbourne** (Phase 1 ✅)
**Grant St → Eric St** (~1.5 km)

- **Status**: Phase 1 Pilot Complete
- **Monitoring Sites**: Grant St, Campbell Barracks, Eric St (3 × 2 directions = 6 sites)
- **Characteristics**: Campbell Barracks creates natural barrier, very few side access points
- **Key Feature**: Army facility on one side = no civilian traffic entry/exit

#### 3. **Stirling Highway - Mosman Park** (Phase 1 ✅)
**Forrest St → Victoria St** (~3 km)

- **Status**: Phase 1 Pilot Complete
- **Monitoring Sites**: Forrest St, Bay View Terrace, McCabe St, Victoria St (4 × 2 directions = 8 sites)
- **Characteristics**: Longest stretch, residential arterial, tests algorithm robustness
- **Purpose**: Validate algorithm with more complex side street access

**Total**: 24 monitoring sites (11 locations × 2 directions each) across 3 stretches

**See**: [docs/corridor-architecture.md](docs/corridor-architecture.md) for detailed technical architecture

## The Open Data Gap

### What We Found

Our investigation into Main Roads WA's public traffic data revealed:

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **APIs Offline** | Real-Time + Daily Traffic APIs down since August 2023 |
| **No Timeline** | "No estimated time of resolution" |
| **Sensors Working** | 1,400+ Smart Freeway sensors actively collecting data |
| **Internal Systems** | RTOP platform processes data every 15 minutes |
| **Security Issues** | WA Auditor General found vulnerabilities in Traffic Management System |

### The Paradox

| Internal (Main Roads) | Public Access |
|----------------------|---------------|
| Real-time data from 1,400+ sensors | APIs offline 16+ months |
| 15-minute processing intervals | Annual averages only |
| Sophisticated RTOP dashboard | No functional APIs |
| 24/7 Operations Centre | "Contact 138 138" |

### What We're Advocating For

1. **Restore the broken APIs** — they were previously public
2. **Publish Smart Freeway sensor data** — taxpayers funded it
3. **Follow NSW's example** — Transport for NSW provides excellent open data
4. **Consider citizen-augmented monitoring** — we can help, not replace

**See**: [docs/mainroads-api-investigation.md](docs/mainroads-api-investigation.md) for full research with citations.

## How It Works

### 1. Vehicle Detection (ESP32-CAM)

```
Camera → FOMO Inference → Counting Algorithm → Stats
```

- ESP32-CAM captures frame (QVGA 320x240)
- Edge Impulse FOMO detects vehicles (on-device)
- Counting algorithm tracks vehicles crossing virtual line
- Accumulates stats: total count, hourly count, confidence

### 2. Data Upload (SIM7000A)

```
ESP32 → SIM7000A → 4G LTE → Backend API
```

- Every 60 seconds, upload JSON stats to backend
- Optional: Upload detection images for validation
- Uses ~200-500MB/month data

### 3. Backend Storage (Express + SQLite)

```
API → SQLite → Aggregation → Dashboard
```

- Stores detection events in SQLite
- Aggregates statistics (hourly, daily)
- Serves data to web dashboard via REST API

### 4. Speed Estimation Algorithm

```
Vehicle Counts → Traffic Flow Theory → Estimated Speed
(Per stretch)     (Flow ÷ Density)      (5-65 km/h)
```

- Calculate average vehicle flow per stretch per direction
- Apply traffic flow theory: Speed = Flow ÷ Density
- Calibrated for 60 km/h arterial roads
- Colour-code routes: Green (flowing) → Orange (moderate) → Red (heavy) → Dark Red (gridlock)

**See**: [docs/corridor-architecture.md](docs/corridor-architecture.md) for algorithm details and evolution roadmap

### 5. Visualisation (Web Dashboard)

```
Dashboard → Fetch API → Chart.js → User
```

- Real-time traffic statistics across 3 stretches
- Colour-coded route visualisation (6 routes: 3 stretches × 2 directions)
- Hourly traffic flow chart with speed estimates
- "Should I drive now?" intelligence
- Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

---

## Accuracy

**Target**: >70% detection accuracy in real-world conditions

**Factors affecting accuracy**:
- Good lighting (daytime, well-lit roads)
- Poor lighting (night, heavy shadows)
- Clear camera view
- Occlusions (trees, rain, fog)
- Medium traffic density
- Very high density (overlapping vehicles)

**Validation**: Manual count vs. automated count over 1 hour

## FAQ

### Q: Is this legal?

**A**: Recording vehicles on public roads is generally legal in Australia (WA Surveillance Devices Act 2016). However:
- Don't record audio (requires consent)
- Don't record private property
- May need permit from City of Perth for installation

See [docs/legal-considerations.md](docs/legal-considerations.md) for details.

### Q: How accurate is it?

**A**: Target is >70% accuracy. Actual accuracy depends on:
- Camera angle and positioning
- Lighting conditions
- Traffic density
- Model training quality

Validate with manual counts.

### Q: What about privacy?

**A**: SwanFlow:
- Uses low-resolution images (QVGA 320x240)
- No facial recognition
- No number plate recognition
- No audio recording
- Anonymous vehicle counts only

### Q: Can I use this commercially?

**A**: Yes! MIT License allows commercial use. However:
- Consult legal advice for privacy compliance
- May need public liability insurance
- Check local regulations

### Q: What's the data usage?

**A**: Estimated ~200-500MB/month per device:
- Stats only: ~9MB/month
- Stats + occasional images: ~150MB/month

### Q: Does it work at night?

**A**: Depends on street lighting:
- Well-lit roads: Yes (requires good ambient light)
- Poorly lit roads: May need IR illumination
- Test at night before deployment

### Q: Can I use WiFi instead of 4G?

**A**: Yes! ESP32-CAM has built-in WiFi:
- Cheaper (no SIM card)
- Requires WiFi access point nearby
- Update firmware to use WiFi instead of LTE

### Q: What about solar power?

**A**: Absolutely!
- 20W solar panel + 12V battery
- Runs 24/7 off-grid
- Add ~$80 to hardware cost
