## System Overview

**SwanFlow** monitors a 6 km arterial corridor in Perth, Western Australia using:

- **18 monitoring sites** with bidirectional tracking (Northbound/Southbound)
- **Edge AI detection** using Edge Impulse FOMO (ML model on ESP32)
- **Real-time speed estimation** using traffic flow theory
- **Interactive dashboard** with colour-coded congestion visualization
- **100% solar-powered** hardware (~$223 AUD per site)
- **$0/month hosting** (Render.com + Vercel free tiers)

### Real-World Application

While SwanFlow demonstrates technical capabilities, it also addresses a real need: Main Roads Western Australia operates 1,400+ Smart Freeway sensors, but their public APIs have been offline since August 2023, and arterial roads lack coverage entirely. SwanFlow explores how **citizen-led monitoring can complement official infrastructure**.

📖 See [docs/mainroads-api-investigation.md](docs/mainroads-api-investigation.md) for research into public data availability.

## Current Deployment: Simulation Mode

**Live Site**: [swanflow.com.au](https://swanflow.com.au) (Vercel) → Backend: [perth-traffic-watch.onrender.com](https://perth-traffic-watch.onrender.com) (Render.com)

### How It Works

The live dashboard currently runs on **simulated traffic data** while hardware is being prepared:

**Backend (Render.com Free Tier)**:
- Express.js API generating realistic traffic patterns for all 18 monitoring sites
- Simulates bidirectional flow (Northbound/Southbound) with time-of-day variations
- SQLite database stores simulated counts and statistics
- **Cost: $0/month** (within 750 hours/month free tier limit)

**Keep-Alive Mechanism (Zero Cost)**:
1. **Primary**: Cron job on Donnacha VPS (45.77.233.102) pings backend every 12 minutes
   ```bash
   */12 * * * * curl -s -X HEAD https://perth-traffic-watch.onrender.com/api/sites
   ```
2. **Redundancy**: Frontend JavaScript pings backend when users have dashboard open
3. **Result**: Backend stays warm 24/7, users get instant data loads (1-2 seconds instead of 30+ second cold starts)

**Why Keep-Alive?**
- Render.com free tier "sleeps" after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Without keep-alive: 30+ second wait for first load
- With keep-alive: Instant data every time

**Simulation → Real Data Transition**:
- Backend API endpoints remain identical
- When ESP32-CAM devices are deployed, they'll POST real counts to same endpoints
- Dashboard seamlessly switches from simulated to real data
- No frontend changes required

**Cost Summary**:
- Backend hosting: **$0** (Render.com free tier)
- Keep-alive cron job: **$0** (runs on existing Donnacha VPS)
- Frontend hosting: **$0** (Vercel free tier)
- **Total: $0/month** 🎉

## Monitored Stretches

### CBD to Fremantle Arterial Corridor (6 km total)

#### Prototype Configuration: Bidirectional Co-Located Installation

**Primary Approach: Bidirectional Co-Located (RECOMMENDED)**
- **2 locations with co-located cameras = 4 sensors**
- **Hardware per location**: 2 × ESP32-CAM modules sharing solar panel, battery, and mounting infrastructure
- **Cost**: **$540 total** ($270 per location)
- **Example**: Crawley + Point Lewis, each with 2 cameras (inbound + outbound)
- **Why This Approach**:
  - ✅ Tests complete bidirectional flow measurement
  - ✅ 40% cheaper than separate installations ($892)
  - ✅ Only $94 more than unidirectional ($446)
  - ✅ Easier permitting (can approach private property owners)
  - ✅ Modular design: each camera fully independent, shares power only
  - ✅ Single mounting structure per location reduces installation complexity

**Hardware Breakdown per Co-Located Location ($270)**:
- **Shared infrastructure** ($150): 20W solar panel ($35), 12V battery ($30), charge controller ($15), large junction box ($50), mounting bracket ($20)
- **Per-camera modules** (×2 = $120): ESP32-CAM ($12), SIM7000A 4G modem ($20), MicroSD card ($8), programmer ($10), wiring/cables ($10)

**Alternative: Unidirectional Prototype (Documentation Only)**
- 2 locations × 1 direction = 2 installations at $223 each = **$446**
- Monitors one direction only (e.g., outbound to Fremantle)
- Simpler but doesn't test full bidirectional capability

#### 1. **Mounts Bay Road** (PoC Target)
**Crawley → Point Lewis** (~1.5 km)

- **Status**: Proof of Concept Target
- **Monitoring Sites**: Crawley (entry), Point Lewis (exit) — 2 co-located installations
- **Characteristics**: Waterfront arterial, **zero side access**, perfect closed segment
- **Why Optimized**: True closed segment needs only entry/exit points
- **PoC Cost**: **$540** (2 co-located locations, 4 cameras total, both directions)

#### 2. **Stirling Highway - Swanbourne** (Phase 2)
**Grant St → Eric St** (~1.5 km)

- **Status**: Future Expansion
- **Monitoring Sites**: Grant St, Campbell Barracks, Eric St (3 × 2 directions = 6 sensors)
- **Characteristics**: Campbell Barracks creates natural barrier, very few side access points
- **Key Feature**: Army facility on one side = minimal civilian traffic entry/exit

#### 3. **Stirling Highway - Mosman Park** (Phase 3)
**Forrest St → Victoria St** (~3 km)

- **Status**: Future Expansion
- **Monitoring Sites**: Forrest St, Bay View Terrace, McCabe St, Victoria St (4 × 2 directions = 8 sensors)
- **Characteristics**: Longest stretch, residential arterial, tests algorithm with side streets
- **Purpose**: Validate algorithm with more complex access patterns

**Total**: 18 monitoring sites (9 locations × 2 directions each) across 3 arterial stretches

**See**: [docs/corridor-architecture.md](docs/corridor-architecture.md) for detailed technical architecture

## A Case for More Open Data

### Current Situation

Main Roads WA operates extensive traffic monitoring infrastructure. Our research found:

| Observation | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Infrastructure** | 1,400+ Smart Freeway sensors collecting real-time data |
| **Internal Systems** | Sophisticated RTOP platform for traffic management |
| **Public APIs** | Currently unavailable (since August 2023) |
| **Operations** | 24/7 Operations Centre managing traffic flow |

We understand that maintaining public-facing APIs requires resources, security considerations, and ongoing support — challenges that may not be immediately visible to outside observers.

### Our Gentle Advocacy

We'd love to see more open traffic data available to researchers and the public:

1. **Public API restoration** — when resources and security concerns allow
2. **Arterial road coverage** — where freeway sensors may not reach
3. **Citizen-augmented data** — complementing (not replacing) official sources
4. **Following leaders like NSW** — Transport for NSW provides excellent open data as a model

**See**: [docs/mainroads-api-investigation.md](docs/mainroads-api-investigation.md) for our research.

## How It Works

### 1. Vehicle Detection (ESP32-CAM)

```
Camera → FOMO Inference → Counting Algorithm → Stats
```

- ESP32-CAM captures frame (QVGA 320x240)
- Edge Impulse FOMO detects vehicles (on-device)
- Counting algorithm tracks vehicles crossing virtual line
- Accumulates stats: total count, hourly count, confidence

### 2. Data Upload (SIM7000A)

```
ESP32 → SIM7000A → 4G LTE → Backend API
```

- Every 60 seconds, upload JSON stats to backend
- Optional: Upload detection images for validation
- Uses ~200-500MB/month data

### 3. Backend Storage (Express + SQLite)

```
API → SQLite → Aggregation → Dashboard
```

- Stores detection events in SQLite
- Aggregates statistics (hourly, daily)
- Serves data to web dashboard via REST API

### 4. Speed Estimation Algorithm

```
Vehicle Counts → Traffic Flow Theory → Estimated Speed
(Per stretch)     (Flow ÷ Density)      (5-65 km/h)
```

- Calculate average vehicle flow per stretch per direction
- Apply traffic flow theory: Speed = Flow ÷ Density
- Calibrated for 60 km/h arterial roads
- Colour-code routes: Green (flowing) → Orange (moderate) → Red (heavy) → Dark Red (gridlock)

**See**: [docs/corridor-architecture.md](docs/corridor-architecture.md) for algorithm details and evolution roadmap

### 5. Visualisation (Web Dashboard)

```
Dashboard → Fetch API → Chart.js → User
```

- Real-time traffic statistics across 3 stretches
- Colour-coded route visualisation (6 routes: 3 stretches × 2 directions)
- Hourly traffic flow chart with speed estimates
- "Should I drive now?" intelligence
- Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

---

## Accuracy

**Target**: >70% detection accuracy in real-world conditions

**Factors affecting accuracy**:
- Good lighting (daytime, well-lit roads)
- Poor lighting (night, heavy shadows)
- Clear camera view
- Occlusions (trees, rain, fog)
- Medium traffic density
- Very high density (overlapping vehicles)

**Validation**: Manual count vs. automated count over 1 hour

---

## Cost Breakdown

### DIY Hardware Costs

The figures below represent **hardware-only costs** for a hobbyist/citizen project. They don't include:
- Professional labour and installation
- Permitting and compliance
- Long-term maintenance contracts
- Integration with existing systems
- Metal fabrication and weatherproofing to commercial standards
- Interdepartmental coordination

Government infrastructure serves different purposes (reliability, coverage, legal compliance, integration) and direct cost comparisons aren't meaningful. SwanFlow is a **complementary proof-of-concept**, not a replacement for professional traffic monitoring.

## FAQ

### Q: Is this legal?

**A**: Recording vehicles on public roads is generally legal in Australia (WA Surveillance Devices Act 2016). However:
- Don't record audio (requires consent)
- Don't record private property
- May need permit from City of Perth for installation

See [docs/legal-considerations.md](docs/legal-considerations.md) for details.

### Q: How accurate is it?

**A**: Target is >70% accuracy. Actual accuracy depends on:
- Camera angle and positioning
- Lighting conditions
- Traffic density
- Model training quality

Validate with manual counts.

### Q: What about privacy?

**A**: SwanFlow:
- Uses low-resolution images (QVGA 320x240)
- No facial recognition
- No number plate recognition
- No audio recording
- Anonymous vehicle counts only

### Q: Can I use this commercially?

**A**: Yes! MIT License allows commercial use. However:
- Consult legal advice for privacy compliance
- May need public liability insurance
- Check local regulations

### Q: What's the data usage?

**A**: Estimated ~200-500MB/month per device:
- Stats only: ~9MB/month
- Stats + occasional images: ~150MB/month

### Q: Does it work at night?

**A**: Depends on street lighting:
- Well-lit roads: Yes (requires good ambient light)
- Poorly lit roads: May need IR illumination
- Test at night before deployment

### Q: Can I use WiFi instead of 4G?

**A**: Yes! ESP32-CAM has built-in WiFi:
- Cheaper (no SIM card)
- Requires WiFi access point nearby
- Update firmware to use WiFi instead of LTE

### Q: Why solar power by default?

**A**: Solar makes SwanFlow truly independent:
- **No power outlet needed** - Deploy anywhere
- **Zero ongoing power costs** - Free energy
- **Storm resilient** - Continues during outages
- **Easy relocation** - No rewiring required
- **Lower total cost** - No electrician fees (~$200-500/site saved)
